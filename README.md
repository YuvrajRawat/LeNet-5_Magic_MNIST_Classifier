# Project Title: NeuralVision: Handwritten Digit Recognition

Project Description:

NeuralVision is an innovative deep learning project designed to tackle the fascinating task of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Handwritten digit recognition holds immense significance in various fields, including finance, postal services, and automation. This project harnesses the power of neural networks to achieve remarkable accuracy in this endeavor.

Key Features:

LeNet-5 Architecture: The core of NeuralVision is the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network, a classic architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. LeNet-5 comprises multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and fully connected neurons, enabling it to learn intricate patterns in handwritten digits.

MNIST Dataset: The project leverages the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset containing 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). With 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, NeuralVision provides robust training and evaluation.

Training and Evaluation: NeuralVision implements a robust training loop, optimizing model parameters using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss. After training, the model undergoes rigorous evaluation on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization.

Accuracy Assessment: The project utilizes the scikit-learn library to calculate and report the accuracy of the model's predictions. Users can gain insights into the model's performance and assess its suitability for real-world applications.
